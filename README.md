You can call me V, I'm a software engineer. 

Irony isn't lost on me as I did a full circle during decade+ of experience from full-stack GUI applications to intense backend work and now back again to the full-stack. Tools change, knowledge grows, but a good backend always deserves a face, even if one becomes quite skilled in hand waving the ideas 💫

- 🦀 Nowadays, I do humble programming with Rust, whilst Python happened to be the primary language across many years before.

- ⚔️  Nothing beats an easy-going collaborative team, when you saw one or even got to build it once, it's something to strive and care for. Such a rare beast!

- 🛰️ Here could be a "zero days in the office" badge. I started working remotely since 2012, way before it became mainstream and fancy async tools appeared, turns out, in a good company it's not that difficult to figure it out and insanely beneficial.

Appreciate your time reading this, reach out if you'd like to. Cheers! ✮ ⋆˙
